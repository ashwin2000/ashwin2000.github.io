Xhaka has been a player who has divided opinions about his time at Arsenal, but in recent times has been an undoubtedly important part of Mikel Arteta’s midfield. While some may bring up his error-prone nature, the midfield just hasn’t looked right without him in it, especially with new signing Thomas Partey having spent most of his time injured in his first season in the Premiership. Another major positive about Xhaka is that he’s hardly ever not available for selection. Looking back at the past season and the gruelling schedule which the players had to endure, it wasn’t surprising to see the number of injuries that occurred as a consequence of this. What was surprising though was seeing Xhaka play through this schedule, mid-week and weekend, maintaining high fitness levels. His ball retention and carrying abilities are also underrated aspects of his.

As seen here he is amongst the best progressive passers in the world while maintaining excellent pass completion percentages. One could go so far as to even claim his passing stats have been world-class over the past few seasons and has been so underrated by Arsenal and rival fans alike and has only been given the respect he deserves after his performances at the Euros for Switzerland.

He has been linked with a move away from Arsenal since the start of the window and looking at the situation, a departure seems likely. Jose Mourinho, after taking over the reins at Roma has indentified him as the first choice target for the midfield and after his performances at the Euros other clubs like PSG and Juventus have entered the fray. The supposed fee wanted by Arsenal is in the range of 20 million euros.

So what are we looking for in a Xhaka replacement? Someone younger than 27 years for obvious reasons. Preferably someone with a decent injury record, with star players getting injured at crucial points in the season being a very prevalent issue for Arsenal in the past. And obviously, someone who replicates Xhaka’s best qualities, specifically his passing. While I do love searching for gems outside the top 5 leagues using data, I’ve limited my search to players within the top leagues due to lack of data and also because players from outside cant realistically take up the mantle of a starter for a traditional top 6 club in the Premiership.
