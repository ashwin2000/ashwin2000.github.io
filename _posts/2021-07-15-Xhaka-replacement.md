Xhaka has been a player who has divided opinions about his time at Arsenal, but in recent times has been an undoubtedly important part of Mikel Arteta’s midfield. While some may bring up his error-prone nature, the midfield just hasn’t looked right without him in it, especially with new signing Thomas Partey having spent most of his time injured in his first season in the Premiership. Another major positive about Xhaka is that he’s hardly ever not available for selection. Looking back at the past season and the gruelling schedule which the players had to endure, it wasn’t surprising to see the number of injuries that occurred as a consequence of this. What was surprising though was seeing Xhaka play through this schedule, mid-week and weekend, maintaining high fitness levels. His ball retention and carrying abilities are also underrated aspects of his.

As seen here he is amongst the best progressive passers in the world while maintaining excellent pass completion percentages. One could go so far as to even claim his passing stats have been world-class over the past few seasons and has been so underrated by Arsenal and rival fans alike and has only been given the respect he deserves after his performances at the Euros for Switzerland.

He has been linked with a move away from Arsenal since the start of the window and looking at the situation, a departure seems likely. Jose Mourinho, after taking over the reins at Roma has indentified him as the first choice target for the midfield and after his performances at the Euros other clubs like PSG and Juventus have entered the fray. The supposed fee wanted by Arsenal is in the range of 20 million euros.

So what are we looking for in a Xhaka replacement? Someone younger than 27 years for obvious reasons. Preferably someone with a decent injury record, with star players getting injured at crucial points in the season being a very prevalent issue for Arsenal in the past. And obviously, someone who replicates Xhaka’s best qualities, specifically his passing. While I do love searching for gems outside the top leagues using data, I’ve limited my search to players within the top leagues due to lack of data and also because players from outside cant realistically take up the mantle of a starter for a traditional top 6 club in the Premiership.
   
   
## Bruno Guimares

The one that got away. First choice for me. I still remember the winter of 2020 in which we signed for Lyon, Arsenal were far ahead in negotiations and almost agreed on a deal but it broke down supposedly because of his parent club asking for part ownership. Didn’t seem to be a problem for Lyon as they moved fast and agreed on a move and even agreed to a sell-on, a move that seems to have paid off big time for them seeing as they got a potential world-class player for just 20 million euros.

His passing is impressive with 88.9% of all attempted passes completed. In addition to this, he averages almost the same amount of progressive passes as Xhaka and is in fact a better carrier of the ball. He’s also more involved in the final third, which is evident by his better xA, xG and Shot Creating Actions per 90. He’s a hard worker off the ball and presses well and is a good ball-winner. He has had the experience of playing in a pivot at Paranaense on the left-hand side and has the ability to play across the midfield so this could prove helpful in case Arteta ever decides to change to a different system.

All things said though, this will be a hard transfer to pull off given his length of contract and Lyon playing in Europe next year. Offering him a good contract and promising a good project may help entice him. Lyon may ask for 40-50 million Euros and I think they may be prepared to sell at this because of how Houssem Aouar’s value regressed from last to this season and also because of the new TV deal which blew up, costing the league millions, putting the teams in a severe cash crunch. Of course, they may choose to sell other people before him.
   
   
## Ryan Gravenberch

![Gravenberch](/assets/img/Gravenberch.jpeg)

Another product of the famous De Toekomst academy, Gravenberch has been touted for great things from a really young age. He made his debut at just 16 years, in fact being the youngest to do so, surpassing the record set by Clarence Seedorf by 112 days.

Quoting ex-Ajax youth coach Brian Tevreden in his interview with Goal, “Physically, I see Frank (Rijkaard) in him from back in the day because he’s tall and very strong”, “Technically, I would say he’s a better version of Pogba in his best days at Juventus, in terms of his technique and his presence on the pitch. He’s very dominant like Pogba was, and that’s what I see in Ryan.”

He’s also someone who is more involved in the attack than Xhaka and is very good at winning the ball high up the pitch. He also excels at carrying the ball into the final third and at progressive passing. It should be of little surprise that Liverpool are a team that are very interested in procuring his services given their high line and the recent departure of Gini Wijnaldum.

Getting him wouldn’t be a difficult task for Arsenal with Ajax being a traditional selling club that allows their top talents to leave for the right price, the most recent ones being Frenkie de Jong, Matthijs De Ligt and Donny Van De Beek. But a lot of clubs retain an interest in him and this in addition to Mino Raiola’s agent fees may be a stumbling block in his addition.
   
   
## Yacine Adli

![Adli](/assets/img/Adli.jpg)

People who have been following Arsenal Transfer news for a while will recognise Adli, we were extensively linked to him in the summer of 2018 and in fact, many even started to believe we had signed him before he took a complete U-Turn and decided to sign a new 3-year contract with PSG after being promised regular minutes. The move proved to be a wrong one with him just playing one senior match and that too for seven minutes. He then moved on to Bordeaux in the next winter window for 5 million pounds.

His career at Bordeaux also didn’t get off to the best start. He started just 7 games and amassed just over 1000 minutes. Things took a turn for the good when the club appointed Jean-Louis Gasset, and Adli has found himself in the teamsheet more often than not. Gasset has Adli sat in the pivot and has mainly tasked him with winning back and progressing the ball. His defensive stats are also impressive and his work rate off the ball is very good as is characterised by his high number of “Pressures per 90”. His offensive stats are also something to not be ignored, his xA and Shot Creating Actions are very high for someone in a pivot.

![Adli stats](/assets/img/Xhaka Adli.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Adli might be the most realistic to get of all the players I’ve written about here who can maybe take Xhaka’s place, with Bordeaux in midtable and strapped for funds because of the recent debacle in Ligue 1 TV rights, which screwed over most Ligue 1 clubs. I’d imagine a bid of about 20 million would be enough to convince them to sell, a 300% profit.
   
   
## Manuel Loactelli

![Locatelli](/assets/img/locatelli.jpg)

The most obvious name to be put on any Xhaka replacement list. He in fact has been advertised by many as a “better Xhaka”. His range of passing is beyond impressive and he can do almost anything from just recycling the ball to maintain possession to line breaking progressive passes to switching the play to the other side through a long ball. He stands out in sides which build up play from the back and enjoy possession, making him a key candidate for the Arsenal midfield spot. His progressive passing in the league is only second to Luiz Alberto, who plays in a more advanced position.

His defensive contribution is also not to be overlooked. His tackles and interceptions per 90 are up there with the best in his league and this is inspite of him playing in possession heavy system under De Zerbi. He’s also aerialy imposing, standing at 6’1 feet, he may also prove handy during corners and set pieces.

![Locatelli stats](/assets/img/Xhaka Locatelli.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

He’s currently of interest to many clubs and at the front of the race are Juventus and Arsenal. Like most Italian players he isnt very enthusiastic about a move outside Italy and so inspite of Arsenal being in a position to pay his transfer fee and give him a better contract, he currently prefers a move to Juve. Arsenal’s chances of signing the player rests entirely on Juve not being able to meet Sassuolo’s demands and seem bleak at the moment.
