The French League has been among the worst hit by the pandemic. Some smaller French clubs are now finding it hard to even pay their staff let alone their players at this time. All this has been because of the greed shown by the board during the renegotiation of the TV deal for the period of 2020-24. In addition to the regular broadcaster in Canal, Mediapro, a mediahouse based in Barcelona, submitted a proposal to broadcast the season at a 60 percent hike as compared to the previous contract held by Canal plus. Canal plus obviously were not prepared to match this offer. The deal was not without its hiccups though, with Mediapro offering no financial security and also at the time having no proper medium to stream the matches. The 60% increase clouded the board's judgement thought and who can really blame them, this deal would have enabled them to compete with the other elites in Europe.

Canal plus chairman, Maxime Saada described the deal as unreasonable and insisted that Mediapro had overpaid. His words proved to be prophetic and Mediapro couldnt get the required amount of subscribers to break even. This resulted in Mediapro defaulting on a 400 million payment due four months into the deal period and requesting a 25 percent haircut on the deal citing Covid 19 as the reason and even this hasnt been paid in full yet. The French clubs and the LFP (Ligue de Football Professionnel) are now surviving with the help of government backed loans. Mediapro is now closing down in France and the deal is now being renegotiated by Canal plus, who are offering a lowball offer of 700 million which is even lower than what they were paying before the new deal with Mediapro was struck. The LFP might have no other choice but to accept their best offer. 

The French Leagues have established themselves as having no dearth of young talents and this could force some clubs to sell their players for a reasonable price. Let's take a look at some of the best talents in France to keep and eye out for in the future and their transfer situations.

## Amine Gouiri

When he left his boyhood club in Lyon to Nice because of a lack of playing time, no one expected him to have the impact he did in Adrian Ursea’s side. He's been the bright spark in an otherwise very dull Nice attack. Not only was he Nice’s top scorer, he was also their top creator, with seven Ligue 1 assists. It was his form and Saliba's addition in the second half of the season which fired Nice to a 9th spot, just 6 points off a European spot after stuggling in relegation zone very long before.

His role in the Nice attack is akin to that of Mohammed Salah in Liverpool, that of an inside forward. He likes to cut inside and deliver a good cross or curl a shot into the far corner. Another thing of note is that this position of his isnt his natural or preffered one, but one of circumstance, he's actually a centre forward. His output is also very respectable with 24 G/A this season in all comps, especially with this being his first regular full season in the senior division. He is a predator in the box and his decision making in the box is really impressive for someone his age. 

While I dont think he may get regular playing time at an elite club right away, he might be able to really shine at a midtable club in the Premier League and one club in particular I'd like to see him at is Brighton under Graham Potter. He could also obviously choose to continue his development at Nice and then make a big money move to a Big club in say one or two seasons. 

## Adil Aouchiche

Another player soon to join the "ones that got away" at Arsenal, he chose to join Saint Etienne over Arsenal and signing a new contract at Paris Saint Germain. PSG wanted to keep him, with the dissolution of their U23 side due to the club believing the costs of running a youth team outweighed the benefits, a number of their exciting youngsters were up for grabs. He prioritised playing time and his progress over a big money move and I respect him for it. Infact it actually seems to have paid off with him having a proper breakthrough season in the previous season having established him as a regular in Claude Puel's side.

He is a modern playmaker, and has all the attributes expected off him, he's versatile, intelligent and technically good. But all this doesnt mean he cant stand his ground in a more physical league like the Premiership. His tackles per 90 was an indicator of how good his defensive capabilities are with him averaging over 2 over the season. His work rate off the ball is very good as is characterised by his high number of “Pressures per 90”. His playing style has drawn comparisons to Hakim Ziyech and Papu Gomez and his creative numbers stacked up against his senior counterparts are actually pretty good. His Shot Creating Actions per 90 are in the top 5 percentile. If he has to improve on anything it would be to increase keeping possession of the ball instead of trying to provide a through ball all the time, so simply put, he needs to improve his pass selection for the senior level.

Since he just arrived last summer and also with Saint Etiene not in any particular cash crunch as compared to the other french clubs, with the sales of Saliba and Fofana in previous seasons for big money, there is no particular urgency to sell as of now. He'd also probably want to stay seeing his progress over the past year. 

## Aurélien Tchouaméni

An important component of the Monaco midfield, he joined Monaco from Bordeaux in the winter of 2020 for a sum of 18 million Euros. He is equally capable of playing both as a 6 or an 8, with especially noteworthy defensive attributes. Chelsea fans have been fancying him as a Kante replacement and such praise does not come easy. Infact I think he is on a similar level as Eduardo Camavinga and will form a daunting pivot alongside him in the French national team in the future.

Initially struggling for gametime after moving clubs, last season has been absolutely massive for Tchouaméni. He started almost every game under Niko Kovac and was absolutely instrumental in their push for Europe while seemed like a far fetched dream after the previous season in which they finished 9th. An absolute monster defensively, he is around 185cm tall and is very good at winning aerial duels, winnning over 2.7 per 90. He like to drive forward with the ball into advanced positions after winning the ball, thereby combining his defensive nous with one eye looking into the final third. This is evident as seen by his superior attacking stats as compared to other traditional Defensive Midfielders.

In addition to Chelsea, Real Madrid have also been looking at him as an alternative to Camavinga, their long term target. Monaco have made a strong push for Europe and have now finished in a Europa League spot and will look to improve on this and get Champions League football next season and keeping Tchouameni will be an integral part of this. But safe to say a bid in the neighborhood of 50 million(like they accepted for Fabinho) might entice them to sell.

## Jérémy Doku

![Doku](/assets/img/doku.jpg)

Now this is a name which is still fresh in everyone's minds, keeping in mind his recent performances in the Euros for Belgium. A product of the famed Anderlecht academy, he's been a long term Liverpool target with Klopp looking at him as a potential successor to Sadio Mane in the future. His biggest strength is definitely his dribbling, he's very direct and likes to take his man, his pace and arsenal of tricks aid him in this. A Left winger in his Anderlecht days, he predominantly played on the right as he was brought in by Rennes to replace Raphinha, who was going to Leeds. If there were anything to improve on, it would be his positioning and decison making in the final third.

While Rennes would be open to sell one of their players to raise funds, I personally think they would sell Camavinga before they sell Doku given his contract period and his stance on signing a new contract. And even if they were forced to sell Doku it would be for a significantly greater amount than the 26 million they paid for him.
