The French League has been among the worst hit by the pandemic. Some smaller French clubs are now finding it hard to even pay their staff let alone their players at this time. All this has been because of the greed shown by the board during the renegotiation of the TV deal for the period of 2020-24. In addition to the regular broadcaster in Canal, Mediapro, a mediahouse based in Barcelona, submitted a proposal to broadcast the season at a 60 percent hike as compared to the previous contract held by Canal plus. Canal plus obviously were not prepared to match this offer. The deal was not without its hiccups though, with Mediapro offering no financial security and also at the time having no proper medium to stream the matches. The 60% increase clouded the board's judgement thought and who can really blame them, this deal would have enabled them to compete with the other elites in Europe.

Canal plus chairman, Maxime Saada described the deal as unreasonable and insisted that Mediapro had overpaid. His words proved to be prophetic and Mediapro couldnt get the required amount of subscribers to break even. This resulted in Mediapro defaulting on a 400 million payment due four months into the deal period and requesting a 25 percent haircut on the deal citing Covid 19 as the reason and even this hasnt been paid in full yet. The French clubs and the LFP (Ligue de Football Professionnel) are now surviving with the help of government backed loans. Mediapro is now closing down in France and the deal is now being renegotiated by Canal plus, who are offering a lowball offer of 700 million which is even lower than what they were paying before the new deal with Mediapro was struck. The LFP might have no other choice but to accept their best offer. 

The French Leagues have established themselves as having no dearth of young talents and this could force some clubs to sell their players for a reasonable price. Let's take a look at some of the best talents and how they'd fit in at elite clubs.
