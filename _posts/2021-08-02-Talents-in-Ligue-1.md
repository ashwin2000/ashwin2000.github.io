## What is the problem haunting French Football?

The French League has been among the worst hit by the pandemic. Some smaller French clubs are now finding it hard to even pay their staff let alone their players at this time. All this has been because of the greed shown by the board during the renegotiation of the TV deal for the period of 2020-24. In addition to the regular broadcaster in Canal, Mediapro, a mediahouse based in Barcelona, submitted a proposal to broadcast the season at a 60 percent hike as compared to the previous contract held by Canal. Canal obviously were not prepared to match this offer. The deal was not without its hiccups though, with Mediapro offering no financial security and also at the time having no proper medium to stream the matches. The 60% increase clouded the board's judgement thought and who can really blame them, this deal would have enabled them to compete with the other elites in Europe.
